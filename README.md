# Isabellaifs 

Originally from Salvador-BA, but I have lived in Lisbon-PT for around 6 years. Postgraduate in Software Engineering with an emphasis on QA and Testing.
My first “Hello World” was 1 year ago, when I decided to make a transition in my career and start studying in the programming field.
Passionate about cycling, music and nature, some of my hobbies are cycling, traveling and hiking.
